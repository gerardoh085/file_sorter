# file_sorter
- Sorts specific file types and creates new directories if it does not exist in the folder.
- Afterwards, we loop through the inside contents of the directory and sort them into their proper directory based on file type

## How to use:
- User will be prompted to insert their directory path.
- The program will convert the back slashes into forward slashes to avoid errors
- After running the code, the user can check their directory for the changes that were made
